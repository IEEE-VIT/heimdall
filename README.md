# Palette Rooster üêì
Palette Rooster is a Discord Bot that was used in [Palette '21](https://palette.ieeevit.org) to manage the roles of the users based on an invite link to a server. It generates an invite link by its own, and can assign a role to the invite link. That particular role is assigned to the member that joins using that invite link.

## Installation Guidelines
Create an application and a bot using [the documentation](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/bot_application_guide.html?highlight=application%20page#creating-the-bot-application). Administrator permissions are required for the bot, and make sure the bot is placed above every other roles in the server.

1. Install the requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python3 setup-bot.py`
3. Input the Bot Prefix and the Bot Token
4. Choose the database you wish to use from JSON, MySQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
5. Input the credentials for the database as and when required.
6. Run `python3 run-bot.py`
7. Voila! Your bot is running!
